# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to glTFast! We are
incredibly excited to see how members of our community will use and extend
glTFast. To facilitate your contributions, we've outlined a brief set
of guidelines to ensure that your extensions can be easily integrated.

## Communication

Please read through our [code of conduct][COC], as we
expect all our contributors to follow it.

For inquiries of all sorts, feel free to raise an issue by going to the
[issues page][issues] and click the *New issue* button.

If you're looking for ideas on ways to contribute browse the [issues][issues],
especially ones with the `help wanted` or `good first issue` label.

## Preparation

Before starting to work on a contribution we recommend searching within the
existing [issues][issues] and [pull requests][pulls] for similar topics to
avoid redundant efforts and make sure you got all contextual information.

Feel free to propose ideas upfront via an [issue][issues] that briefly outlines
your intended changes. We'll then try to give you advice and feedback on how to
optimally implement those changes or, if justifiable, reasons to abandon an
idea. This pre-evaluation can raise the chances of getting a contribution
accepted.

## Version Control

*glTFast* uses [Git][Git] and [GitHub][repo] for version control.

## Submission via Pull Request

Changes can be proposed via [pull requests (PR)][GithubDocPR] on the [pull requests][pulls] page.

Please make sure that your PR contains the following:

- Detailed description of the changes performed
- Corresponding changes to documentation, changelog and unit tests
- Summary of the tests performed to validate your changes
- Issue numbers that the PR resolves (if any)

PRs will be transferred to an internal, mirrored repository to undergo review and (automated) tests that use Unity's internal tools and infrastructure. If those tests and reviews are not successful, we'll help you resolve remaining issues and merge your work, once it passes all tests. The merge will happen on the mirrored repository and the original pull requests will get closed with a proper notification about expected release version and date.

## Contributor License Agreements

When you open a pull request, you will be asked to acknowledge our Contributor
License Agreement. You will have to confirm that your Contributions are your
original creation and that you have complete right and authority to make your
contributions. We allow both individual contributions and contributions made on
behalf of companies.
